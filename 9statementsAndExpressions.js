// An expression is a picece of code that produces a value E.G. (3 + 4), 1991,
// true && false !false.
// A statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed, and doesn't produce a 
// value on itself. E.G. 
if (23 > 10) {
    console.log(`23 is bigger`); // the string itself is an expression
}  // this itself doesn't produce a value, it only does an action (declaring a 
// variable in this case )
